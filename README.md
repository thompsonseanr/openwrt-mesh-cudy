## OpenWrt Playbook for Cudy M3000 v1 routers.
---

Work based upon this great tutorial:  [OpenWRT Batman Mesh Tutorial](https://github.com/benkay86/openwrt-batman-tutorial)

*Unfortunately, this is still a work in progress and I have not been successful with the mesh nodes yet.*

This was done using the latest OpenWrt firmware using the [OpenWrt firmware selector tool](https://firmware-selector.openwrt.org/)

The opkg packages used are found in the `install-pks` role
